## Technical & copyright stuff:

About API using:

Although the game supports tkinter PhotoImage as well, I still highly recommend you to install PIL library to have best visual experience.

Also, try to run it On Windows to get best gameplay experience. Linux(better to run on physical machine rather than virtual machine) and Mac OS are both fine.

**But do not run on WSL**
